# CRX-Project
Hello all!
This is my first ever big project I will be making on Python!

My goal is to be able to be in the area of my university campus and have a twitter bot automatically send me a tweet to ask if i want to have an order placed at the loal timhortons.

Why would you even make this... its so extra...

Well its because I really hate the long lines and i always forget to order my stuff in advanced too, plus i wanna get my ahnds on some api Work!

Change Log:

2022-11-11:
- Created script to track location of my iphone using an api called pyicloud.
-The cordinates of my iphone will be detetced once i run the script
