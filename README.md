# CRX-Project
Hello all!
This is my first ever big project I will be making on Python!

My goal is to be able to be in the area of my university campus and have a twitter bot automatically send me a tweet to ask if i want to have an order placed at the loal timhortons.

Why would you even make this... its so extra...

Well its because I really hate the long lines and i always forget to order my stuff in advanced too, plus i wanna get my ahnds on some api Work!

HELLO ALL IT HAS BEEN A WHILE!
I have been studying very hard on my exams and i havent had the time to really work on my project. However, i have been slowly revamping the prject and the plan i have should be fully completed over my winter break! I'm revamping everything after brainstorming very hard for a long time!

I have been stuck for a while on what to do with the coordinate i was able to get from my location tracker.
I then did the following:
  - I created a custom map omn google maps that is the area where i would like my program to be executed
  - I then created a function that takes the point from the iPhone location tracker (or any point as a parameter) 
  - if the function returns true, then the main timhortons autobot script will execute.
